Creating a causality instance with default configuration:

```js
import CausalityFactory from "/vendor/causalityjs/causality.js";
const Causality = CausalityFactory();
```

`Causality.create` has been renamed `Causality.observe`.


`Causality.independently` is no longer needed for repeaters created inside other repeaters. If nesting is wanted, use
```js
Causality.repeat( repeaterActions, {dependentOnParent: true});
```

`obj.observe(listener)` has been replaced with a single `obj.onChange` listener. Enable events with config `{emitEvents:true}`.
